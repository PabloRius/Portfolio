The fourth year at UC3M was unique as it lasted only until December, as I was preparing for my exchange program in Australia, where I would complete my studies. During these months, I deepened my knowledge in various advanced topics through courses such as:

- Computing Technologies for the Web

- Real-Time Systems

- Multimedia

- AGILE in the Corporate Culture
