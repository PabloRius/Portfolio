Successfully presented my Final Dissertation, achieving a score of 9.1. The thesis focused on creating a dataset of socioeconomic indicators for municipalities in the Community of Madrid, formatted as Linked Open Data.

Additionally, I developed a web application (GIS viewer) to visualize this data on a map, along with various statistics and graphs, aiding decision-making to enhance economic dynamism and territorial cohesion among the municipalities.

This project has been recognized by the LODCoreMadrid Chair for its contribution to economic development through innovative project design.
