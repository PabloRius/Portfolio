My time at UNSW in Sydney was part of a study exchange program, offering a unique opportunity to experience life and culture in a continent that was entirely new to me. Alongside immersing myself in Australian culture, I continued to advance my skills as a software developer through courses such as:

- Software Development Projects Management

- Computer Graphics

- Mobile Devices & Communication Security
