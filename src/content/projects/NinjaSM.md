# üõí SM Ninja - Web Scraper & Product Browser

## üåç Overview

**SM Ninja** is a full-stack application that enables users to browse and filter Tesco supermarket products scraped from the web. The project consists of:

- A **web scraper** that extracts product data and stores it in a CSV file.
- A **backend server** that reads the CSV file, exposes a REST API with filtering and pagination capabilities.
- A **frontend web application** that queries the server and displays products in an interactive and modern UI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### **Web Scraper (Python)**

- Scrapes Tesco‚Äôs website for product data using BeautifulSoup.
- Stores product details (name, price, supermarket, image, etc.) in a CSV file.
- Ensures efficient and structured data extraction.

### **Backend (Java + Spring Boot)**

- Reads the scraped CSV file as a mock database.
- Provides REST API endpoints for:
  - **Fetching products** with pagination.
  - **Filtering** products based on name, price range, and supermarket.
- Ensures performance efficiency with structured API responses.

### **Frontend (Next.js + React)**

- Displays products in a **grid format** with a clean UI.
- Implements **filtering and search** options.
- Supports **pagination** to load products efficiently.
- Each product links to its Tesco page for more details.
- Uses **modern UI/UX** principles with TailwindCSS & Framer Motion for smooth transitions.
